I am a computational scientist with training in biomathematics, biostatistics, and the mathematical sciences, who focuses on developing more descriptive models of infectious disease dynamics to inform and improve public health decision-making. My niche lies in augmenting surveillance systems with public health expertise to generate more realistic predictions of reported infectious disease cases.
