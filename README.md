I am a computational scientist working at the intersection of biostatistics and data science.
I build novel ensemble algorithms to combine computational models, and expert and non-expert human judgment, of infectious disease agents to support public health decision making.
In industry, I spent time as Associate Director of Biostatistics at the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, leading a team of biostatisticians that designed and analyzed multinational clinical trials. For more information visit my website: http://www.thomasmcandrew.com/
